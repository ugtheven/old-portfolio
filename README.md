# My old portfolio using Angular
Month ago, to find my first internship, I created this portfolio. My first web project outside of school was this one.
This is my resume as a single-page application inspired by the Visual Studio Code's interface.

## Interactive mockup

First, I designed an interactive mockup with figma (Here the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/SMuJP8l5ViqWUbCLX21xUC/My-Resume?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=kLEMw7E3CtgYUmoB-1">link</a>)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
